1. Letters (a-z, A-Z) and Digits (0-9):
Python
import re

pattern = r"[a-zA-Z0-9]+"  # Matches one or more alphanumeric characters

text = "This1sAString"
match = re.search(pattern, text)

if match:
    print("String contains only letters and digits")
else:
    print("String contains characters other than letters and digits")
Use code with caution.

2. "a" followed by zero or more "b"s:
Python
pattern = r"ab*"
Use code with caution.
content_copy
3. "a" followed by one or more "b"s:
Python
pattern = r"ab+"
Use code with caution.
content_copy
4. "a" followed by zero or one "b":
Python
pattern = r"ab?"
Use code with caution.

5. "a" followed by exactly three "b"s:
Python
pattern = r"abb{3}"
Use code with caution.
content_copy
6. "a" followed by two or three "b"s:
Python
pattern = r"ab{2,3}"  # {2,3} specifies the range (2 or 3)
Use code with caution.
content_copy
7. "a" followed by anything, ending in "b":
Python
pattern = r"a.*b"  # .* matches any character zero or more times
Use code with caution.

8. Word at the beginning of a string:
Python
pattern = r"\b\w+"  # \b matches word boundary, \w matches word character
Use code with caution.
content_copy
9. Word at the end of a string:
Python
pattern = r"\w+\b"
Use code with caution

10. Four-digit words (0-9, length 4):
Python
pattern = r"\d{4}"  # \d matches digit character, {4} specifies length

text = "01 0132 231875 1458 301 2725."
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

print(matches)  # Output: ['0132', '1458', '2725']
